## My Projects and work experience

### [Camera scanner iOS application](https://github.com/danyarmarkin/camera-scanner)

I was working on creating an iOS application that connects
multiple devices via BLE and allows you to synchronize camera
parameters such as iso, shutter, wb, tint, fps, between them, as
well as synchronize the beginning and end of shooting. This
was necessary to create a 3D model of the scanned object by
photogrammetry.

2021-2022

### [Blender Add-On](https://github.com/danyarmarkin/KanistraAddOn)

I developed an add-on for Blender to distribute 3D models.
The add-on allows you to receive updates with new models, as
well as with fixes for old ones. the addon is written in python,
the backend is written in Django Rest Framework.
